## Introduction

Warren Edward Buffett (born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is currently the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is one of the most successful investors in the world and has a net worth of over $95 billion as of October 2022, making him the world's sixth-wealthiest person.

Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring to and graduating from the University of Nebraska at 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended the New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.

Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970. He is noted for his adherence to value investing, and his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.

## Context

Every year Warren Buffet shares his views about the market and the company's (Berkshire Hathway) stock performance for the year. And, also express his views on the investment opportunity going forward, based on the economic condition.

This dataset is a collection of letters written by him from 1977 - 2021.

If you are into Financial analytics or like analyzing financial data, this dataset can provide the type of data analysis from an NLP standpoint based on the facts and inference made by The Great Warren Buffet. A detailed analysis using the text data can provide some pattern towards what is good with the current economy or what is the risk expected by an investor going forward, and a lot more.

I am really excited to share this dataset on Kaggle and expect diversified analysis using this dataset. Hope you will have fun working with this dataset. Happy Learning!
